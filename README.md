## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo

This theme is more for inspiration than for direct use. Feel free to fork this theme and use it as a starting point for your own project. Take a look at the code and gain some insight into how things are built, and perhaps use some pieces of the code in your own project. However, this theme is specifically written for [binspired.com](https://www.binspired.com) products and may not be suitable for your own project.

Please also note that I did not create this page with the intention of using it as a starter theme. So if you have questions about implementation, please see [build Shopify themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/).
